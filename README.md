# part-time-bioinfo-lecturer-posting

applying to this https://jobs.rutgers.edu/postings/230895 but they said: "Thanks for the information.  You do have a pretty good bioinformatics background.  We've actually moved the course to the spring.  So the situation is different.  There may be a new advertisement."

soooo does that mean the position is closed, id literally teach in jupyter notebooks

new posting: https://jobs.rutgers.edu/postings/236045 -- applying to it!! hopefully i can finish by like early-mid-october

i would use this book: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-cookbook-3rd/9781449357337/ as the required text, python cookbook and use jupyter notebooks

"I'd still like to encourage you to apply.  We only have one applicant right now.  So if you are still interested, there is a good chance you could get it"

im gonna finish applying this week
