# part-time-bioinfo-lecturer-posting

applying to this https://jobs.rutgers.edu/postings/230895 but they said: "Thanks for the information.  You do have a pretty good bioinformatics background.  We've actually moved the course to the spring.  So the situation is different.  There may be a new advertisement."

soooo does that mean the position is closed, id literally teach in jupyter notebooks
